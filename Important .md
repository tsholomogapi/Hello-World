The most important thing is making sure I understand the work. This is a great opportunity to familarise myself with industry knowledge. Aiming to finish cards will be a futile exercise because I will not absorb as much information. There is so much to learn from this bootcamp, so understanding the work will help in the long run. Understanding the work will be beneficial once I step into corporate.
